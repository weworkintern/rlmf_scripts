      "    \"initial_reasoning\": \"Got it, let's start by correcting the approach and then writing the code. First, I need to remember the key insight from similar problems: each swap operation on k allows us to choose whether the k-th row is the original row or the original column. But since swapping k affects both row k and column k, we need to model dependencies between indices using a parity DSU (Union-Find with bipartition) to track whether two indices must have the same or opposite parity (swap state).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWait, let's go back to the problem's core. The operation swaps row k with column k. Let's think about what this means for the final matrix. For any cell (i, j), after some swaps, its value can be either A[i][j] or A[j][i], but with constraints: if (i, j) uses A[j][i], then (j, i) must use A[i][j], and vice versa. Also, for cells (i, k) and (k, j), the choices must be consistent (e.g., if i and k have a parity constraint, and k and j have another, then i and j's constraint is determined).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe correct approach, as per competitive programming solutions for similar problems (like matrix lex smallest with swap constraints), is:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Model Constraints**: For each pair (i, j), if we decide that the final cell (i, j) should be the minimum of A[i][j] and A[j][i], we need to enforce the corresponding parity constraint (same or different) between i and j. However, we must process these constraints in a way that ensures global consistency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWait, no\\\\u2014actually, the correct way is to realize that the matrix elements form a graph where each cell (i, j) (i < j) connects i and j with an edge that has a \\\\\\\\\\\"preference\\\\\\\\\\\" (whether we want i and j to have the same or different parity to get the minimum value). But since we need lex smallest, we process cells in row-major order, and for each cell (i, j), we make the minimal choice possible given the current constraints.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBut let's look at the sample input 1:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOriginal matrix:\\\\\\\\n2 1 2\\\\\\\\n2 1 2\\\\\\\\n1 1 2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSample output:\\\\\\\\n2 1 1\\\\\\\\n2 1 1\\\\\\\\n2 2 2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet's see cell (1,3): original A[1][3] is 2, A[3][1] is 1. To get the minimal value (1), we need to swap row 3 (so that (1,3) takes A[3][1]). Which aligns with the sample operation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAh, right! So for cell (i, j), if we want B[i][j] to be the minimum of A[i][j] and A[j][i], we need to set the parity of i and j such that:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- If min_val is A[i][j], then parity[i] == parity[j] (since B[i][j] = A[i][j] when same parity).\\\\\\\\n- If min_val is A[j][i], then parity[i] != parity[j] (since B[i][j] = A[j][i] when different parity).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBut we must ensure that these choices are consistent across the matrix. For example, if we choose parity[i] != parity[j] for cell (i, j), then for cell (j, k), our choice must not contradict this.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo the steps are:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Parity DSU**: Use a DSU that tracks the parity (relative to root) for each node. This allows us to check if a constraint (same or different parity) between two nodes is possible.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. **Process Cells in Row-Major Order**: For each cell (i, j) in row-major order (from (1,1) to (n,n)):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   a. If i == j: B[i][j] = A[i][j] (since parity[i] == parity[i] always).\\\\\\\\n   b. If i > j: B[i][j] is determined by B[j][i] and the parity of i and j. Specifically, if parity[i] == parity[j], then B[i][j] = A[i][j]; else, B[i][j] = A[j][i]. But wait, no\\\\u2014since (i, j) is the transpose of (j, i), once we process (j, i), (i, j) is determined. So we can skip processing (i, j) when i > j.\\\\\\\\n   c. If i < j: We want to choose B[i][j] to be the minimal possible value (min(A[i][j], A[j][i])), but only if this choice is consistent with existing constraints. If it's not, we have to take the other value. Then, we enforce the corresponding constraint (same or different parity) between i and j using the DSU.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. **Build the Result Matrix**: After determining all parity constraints, construct the result matrix using the parity array. For each cell (i, j), if parity[i] == parity[j], use A[i][j]; else, use A[j][i].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWait, yes! Because once we have the parity array (toggled or not for each index), building the matrix is straightforward.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBut how do we get the parity array? The DSU with parity tracks the relative parity between nodes. We need to assign an absolute parity (0 or 1) to each root, then compute the parity of each node relative to the root.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBut for lex smallest, when processing (i, j) in row-major order, we make the minimal choice possible. Let's formalize this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor cell (i, j) where i < j:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Compute the two possible values: val0 = A[i][j] (same parity), val1 = A[j][i] (different parity).\\\\\\\\n- Check if i and j are already connected in the DSU.\\\\\\\\n  - If connected: Get the current required parity (same or different) between i and j. We must choose the corresponding value.\\\\\\\\n  - If not connected: Choose the minimal value (min(val0, val1)). Enforce the corresponding parity constraint between i and j.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce all constraints are enforced, we can assign absolute parity values (0 or 1) to each root. For lex smallest, we can set the root's parity to 0 (since flipping all parities in a component would swap val0 and val1 for all cells in that component, but we already chose the minimal possible when connecting components).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, let's implement this.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, the parity DSU:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe need a DSU that can:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Find the root of a node and the parity from the node to the root.\\\\\\\\n- Union two nodes with a required parity (same or different).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn C++, we can implement this with two arrays: parent and rank (for DSU), and a parity array (par) that stores the parity from the node to its parent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe find function will use path compression and update the parity.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen, for each test case:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Read n and the matrix (using 1-based indexing for ease).\\\\\\\\n- Initialize the DSU for n nodes.\\\\\\\\n- For each cell (i, j) in row-major order (i from 1 to n, j from 1 to n):\\\\\\\\n  - if i > j: continue (processed when j < i)\\\\\\\\n  - if i == j: B[i][j] = A[i][j]; continue\\\\\\\\n  - val0 = A[i][j] (same parity)\\\\\\\\n  - val1 = A[j][i] (different parity)\\\\\\\\n  - Find root of i (ri) and parity from i to ri (pi)\\\\\\\\n  - Find root of j (rj) and parity from j to rj (pj)\\\\\\\\n  - if ri == rj:\\\\\\\\n    - required_parity = pi ^ pj (current parity between i and j)\\\\\\\\n    - if required_parity == 0:\\\\\\\\n      B[i][j] = val0\\\\\\\\n      B[j][i] = A[j][i]  // since same parity, B[j][i] = A[j][i]\\\\\\\\n    else:\\\\\\\\n      B[i][j] = val1\\\\\\\\n      B[j][i] = A[i][j]  // since different parity, B[j][i] = A[i][j]\\\\\\\\n  - else:\\\\\\\\n    // Choose the minimal value\\\\\\\\n    if val0 <= val1:\\\\\\\\n      // Enforce same parity between i and j (pi ^ pj ^ new_parity = 0)\\\\\\\\n      // new_parity is the parity between ri and rj: pi ^ pj ^ 0 = pi ^ pj\\\\\\\\n      union_nodes(i, j, 0)\\\\\\\\n      B[i][j] = val0\\\\\\\\n      B[j][i] = A[j][i]\\\\\\\\n    else:\\\\\\\\n      // Enforce different parity between i and j (pi ^ pj ^ new_parity = 1)\\\\\\\\n      // new_parity = pi ^ pj ^ 1\\\\\\\\n      union_nodes(i, j, 1)\\\\\\\\n      B[i][j] = val1\\\\\\\\n      B[j][i] = A[i][j]\\\\\\\\n- Finally, output the matrix B.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWait, no\\\\u2014when i < j, after choosing B[i][j], B[j][i] is determined by the parity. For example, if we choose B[i][j] = val0 (same parity), then B[j][i] must be A[j][i] (since same parity). If we choose B[i][j] = val1 (different parity), then B[j][i] must be A[i][j] (since different parity). That's correct.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBut wait, let's test this with sample input 1:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSample Input 1:\\\\\\\\n3\\\\\\\\n2 1 2\\\\\\\\n2 1 2\\\\\\\\n1 1 2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProcessing cell (1,3) (i=1, j=3):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nval0 = A[1][3] = 2, val1 = A[3][1] = 1. val1 is smaller. So we enforce different parity between 1 and 3. Then B[1][3] = 1, B[3][1] = A[1][3] = 2. Which matches the sample output.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYes! That's exactly what the sample does.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother example: cell (1,2) in sample input 1:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA[1][2] = 1, A[2][1] = 2. val0 is smaller (1). So enforce same parity between 1 and 2. B[1][2] = 1, B[2][1] = 2. Which matches the sample.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGreat! So this approach works.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, let's implement the parity DSU correctly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe DSU with parity:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nstruct DSU {\\\\\\\\n    vector<int> parent;\\\\\\\\n    vector<int> rank;\\\\\\\\n    vector<int> par;  // parity from node to parent (0: same, 1: different)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    DSU(int n) {\\\\\\\\n        parent.resize(n+1);\\\\\\\\n        rank.resize(n+1, 0);\\\\\\\\n        par.resize(n+1, 0);\\\\\\\\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {\\\\\\\\n            parent[i] = i;\\\\\\\\n        }\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    pair<int, int> find(int u) {\\\\\\\\n        if (parent[u] != u) {\\\\\\\\n            auto [root, p] = find(parent[u]);\\\\\\\\n            parent[u] = root;\\\\\\\\n            par[u] ^= p;\\\\\\\\n        }\\\\\\\\n        return {parent[u], par[u]};\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    void unite(int u, int v, int req_par) {\\\\\\\\n        auto [ru, pu] = find(u);\\\\\\\\n        auto [rv, pv] = find(v);\\\\\\\\n        if (ru == rv) return;\\\\\\\\n        if (rank[ru] < rank[rv]) {\\\\\\\\n            swap(ru, rv);\\\\\\\\n            swap(pu, pv);\\\\\\\\n            swap(u, v);\\\\\\\\n        }\\\\\\\\n        parent[rv] = ru;\\\\\\\\n        par[rv] = pu ^ pv ^ req_par;\\\\\\\\n        if (rank[ru] == rank[rv]) {\\\\\\\\n            rank[ru]++;\\\\\\\\n        }\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n};\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExplanation:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- The find function returns the root of u and the parity from u to the root. It uses path compression, updating the parent and parity of u to point directly to the root.\\\\\\\\n- The unite function unites two sets (ru and rv) with a required parity (req_par) between u and v. The parity of rv (the child) is set to pu ^ pv ^ req_par, which ensures that the required parity between u and v is maintained.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, processing each test case:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor each test case:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Read n.\\\\\\\\n- Read the matrix A (1-based).\\\\\\\\n- Initialize DSU with n.\\\\\\\\n- Initialize the result matrix B (1-based).\\\\\\\\n- For i from 1 to n:\\\\\\\\n  - For j from 1 to n:\\\\\\\\n    - if i > j: continue (since we process i < j first)\\\\\\\\n    - if i == j:\\\\\\\\n      B[i][j] = A[i][j];\\\\\\\\n      continue;\\\\\\\\n    - int val0 = A[i][j];\\\\\\\\n    - int val1 = A[j][i];\\\\\\\\n    - auto [ru, pu] = dsu.find(i);\\\\\\\\n    - auto [rv, pv] = dsu.find(j);\\\\\\\\n    - if (ru == rv):\\\\\\\\n      // Check current parity between i and j: pu ^ pv\\\\\\\\n      int current_par = pu ^ pv;\\\\\\\\n      if (current_par == 0) {\\\\\\\\n        B[i][j] = val0;\\\\\\\\n        B[j][i] = A[j][i];\\\\\\\\n      } else {\\\\\\\\n        B[i][j] = val1;\\\\\\\\n        B[j][i] = A[i][j];\\\\\\\\n      }\\\\\\\\n    - else:\\\\\\\\n      // Choose the minimal value\\\\\\\\n      if (val0 <= val1) {\\\\\\\\n        // Enforce same parity (req_par = 0)\\\\\\\\n        dsu.unite(i, j, 0);\\\\\\\\n        B[i][j] = val0;\\\\\\\\n        B[j][i] = A[j][i];\\\\\\\\n      } else {\\\\\\\\n        // Enforce different parity (req_par = 1)\\\\\\\\n        dsu.unite(i, j, 1);\\\\\\\\n        B[i][j] = val1;\\\\\\\\n        B[j][i] = A[i][j];\\\\\\\\n      }\\\\\\\\n- Output the matrix B.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWait, but when i < j, we set B[i][j] and B[j][i] immediately. Is this correct?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYes! Because when we process (i, j) where i < j, we are making the choice for both (i, j) and (j, i) based on the minimal possible value (or the required value if connected). Since we process in row-major order, (i, j) comes before (j, i) (for i < j, (i, j) is at position (i-1)*n + j, and (j, i) is at (j-1)*n + i. Since i < j, (i-1)*n + j < (j-1)*n + i \\\\u2192 because (i-1)*n + j - [(j-1)*n + i] = n(i-1 - j + 1) + (j - i) = n(i - j) + (j - i) = (i - j)(n - 1) < 0). So (i, j) is processed before (j, i), so we can set both values at once.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTesting this with sample input 1:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor (1, 3):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nval0 = 2, val1 = 1. val1 is smaller. So we unite 1 and 3 with req_par=1 (different parity). Then B[1][3] = 1, B[3][1] = 2. Which is correct.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor (3, 1): since i > j, we skip.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYes! That's correct.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother test: (2, 3) in sample input 1:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA[2][3] = 2, A[3][2] = 1. When processing (2, 3):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCheck if 2 and 3 are connected. Since 1 and 2 are connected (same parity), 1 and 3 are connected (different parity), so 2 and 3 are connected (different parity). So current_par = 1. So B[2][3] = A[3][2] = 1, B[3][2] = A[2][3] = 2. Which matches the sample.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGreat! This works.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, let's write the code.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, include necessary headers:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#include <iostream>\\\\\\\\n#include <vector>\\\\\\\\n#include <algorithm>\\\\\\\\nusing namespace std;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen, the DSU struct:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nstruct DSU {\\\\\\\\n    vector<int> parent;\\\\\\\\n    vector<int> rank;\\\\\\\\n    vector<int> par;

      "    \"response\": \"Got it, let's start by correcting the approach and then writing the code. First, I need to remember the key insight from similar problems: each swap operation on k allows us to choose whether the k-th row is the original row or the original column. But since swapping k affects both row k and column k, we need to model dependencies between indices using a parity DSU (Union-Find with bipartition) to track whether two indices must have the same or opposite parity (swap state).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWait, let's go back to the problem's core.\\\\nThe operation swaps row k with column k. Let's think about what this means for the final matrix.\\\\nFor any cell (i, j), after some swaps, its value can be either A[i][j] or A[j][i], but with constraints: if (i, j) uses A[j][i], then (j, i) must use A[i][j], and vice versa. Also, for cells (i, k) and (k, j), the choices must be consistent (e.g., if i and k have a parity constraint, and k and j have another, then i and j's constraint is determined).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe correct approach, as per competitive programming solutions for similar problems (like matrix lex smallest with swap constraints), is:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Model Constraints**: For each pair (i, j), if we decide that the final cell (i, j) should be the minimum of A[i][j] and A[j][i], we need to enforce the corresponding parity constraint (same or different) between i and j.\\\\nHowever, we must process these constraints in a way that ensures global consistency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWait, no\\\\u2014actually, the correct way is to realize that the matrix elements form a graph where each cell (i, j) (i < j) connects i and j with an edge that has a \\\\\\\\\\\"preference\\\\\\\\\\\" (whether we want i and j to have the same or different parity to get the minimum value).\\\\nBut since we need lex smallest, we process cells in row-major order, and for each cell (i, j), we make the minimal choice possible given the current constraints.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBut let's look at the sample input 1:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOriginal matrix:\\\\\\\\n2 1 2\\\\\\\\n2 1 2\\\\\\\\n1 1 2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSample output:\\\\\\\\n2 1 1\\\\\\\\n2 1 1\\\\\\\\n2 2 2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet's see cell (1,3): original A[1][3] is 2, A[3][1] is 1. To get the minimal value (1), we need to swap row 3 (so that (1,3) takes A[3][1]). Which aligns with the sample operation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAh, right! So for cell (i, j), if we want B[i][j] to be the minimum of A[i][j] and A[j][i], we need to set the parity of i and j such that:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- If min_val is A[i][j], then parity[i] == parity[j] (since B[i][j] = A[i][j] when same parity).\\\\\\\\n- If min_val is A[j][i], then parity[i] != parity[j] (since B[i][j] = A[j][i] when different parity).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBut we must ensure that these choices are consistent across the matrix.\\\\nFor example, if we choose parity[i] != parity[j] for cell (i, j), then for cell (j, k), our choice must not contradict this.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo the steps are:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Parity DSU**: Use a DSU that tracks the parity (relative to root) for each node.\\\\nThis allows us to check if a constraint (same or different parity) between two nodes is possible.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. **Process Cells in Row-Major Order**: For each cell (i, j) in row-major order (from (1,1) to (n,n)):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   a. If i == j: B[i][j] = A[i][j] (since parity[i] == parity[i] always).\\\\\\\\n   b. If i > j: B[i][j] is determined by B[j][i] and the parity of i and j. Specifically, if parity[i] == parity[j], then B[i][j] = A[i][j]; else, B[i][j] = A[j][i]. But wait, no\\\\u2014since (i, j) is the transpose of (j, i), once we process (j, i), (i, j) is determined. So we can skip processing (i, j) when i > j.\\\\\\\\n   c.\\\\nIf i < j: We want to choose B[i][j] to be the minimal possible value (min(A[i][j], A[j][i])), but only if this choice is consistent with existing constraints. If it's not, we have to take the other value. Then, we enforce the corresponding constraint (same or different parity) between i and j using the DSU.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. **Build the Result Matrix**: After determining all parity constraints, construct the result matrix using the parity array.\\\\n<abandon>For each cell (i, j), if parity[i] == parity[j], use A[i][j]; else, use A[j][i].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWait, yes! Because once we have the parity array (toggled or not for each index), building the matrix is straightforward.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBut how do we get the parity array? The DSU with parity tracks the relative parity between nodes. We need to assign an absolute parity (0 or 1) to each root, then compute the parity of each node relative to the root.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBut for lex smallest, when processing (i, j) in row-major order, we make the minimal choice possible.</abandon><reason>I realized that in the current implementation, I assumed that once a decision was made between val0 and val1 for a pair of elements, the parity between those indices would be handled correctly by the DSU. However, I didn't fully account for the possibility that previous unions could create conflicting parity constraints when processing later indices. This can lead to incorrect parity handling, resulting in a wrong choice of the minimal value between val0 and val1. By not fully ensuring the consistency of the parity relationships across all nodes, I risk introducing errors that will affect the final matrix, making it lexicographically incorrect.</reason>\\\\n<abandon>Got it, let's continue refining the reasoning and steps to address the parity constraint consistency issue mentioned in the self-criticism. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, let's formalize the parity DSU (also called a bipartite DSU or DSU with potential).</abandon><intervene>The current implementation here doesn't handle the scenario correctly when two indices (i and j) are already connected in the same set in the DSU, and their parity is fixed. The logic assumes that once we determine the parity between two indices, we can freely select the minimal value (val0 or val1) from the pair (A[i][j], A[j][i]). However, when i and j are already united in the same set, their parity is already determined by the previous unions, and we must respect this established parity.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, if during the processing of cell (i, j) we select val0 based on the lexicographically smallest value but the existing parity between i and j contradicts this selection, we must instead choose val1. Failing to respect this parity constraint could result in an incorrect matrix.\\\\n\\\\nThe current implementation doesn't account for these conflicts when i and j are in the same component (set) and may select an invalid minimal value, which leads to incorrect results.</intervene>\\\\n<abandon>Got it, let's continue refining the reasoning from where the Partial_Solution left off. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I need to clarify the Parity DSU (also called a Union-Find with bipartition or a DSU that tracks parity relative to the root).</abandon><reason>Hmm\\\\u2026 in this step, I started building the DSU with parity and said I\\\\u2019d decide parity between i and j based on the comparison between A[i][j] and A[j][i]. But I didn\\\\u2019t stop to think whether i and j might already be part of the same DSU component with a fixed parity relationship.\\\\n\\\\nThat\\\\u2019s a big miss. The flaw starts with blindly enforcing a new parity constraint based on the current comparison, without checking if a parity path already exists between i and j. If such a path exists, then my new constraint might directly contradict it, and I wouldn\\\\u2019t even notice.\\\\n\\\\nThis breaks the integrity of the DSU, because I now have conflicting parity states between connected nodes. As a result, any matrix built using these invalid parity assignments could be incorrect \\\\u2014 even if I try to apply the lexicographical logic later on.</reason>\\\\n<abandon>Got it, let's pick up from the Partial_Solution's key point about handling existing DSU constraints when processing cell (i,j). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I need to formalize how to handle the (i,j) cell when i < j.</abandon><intervene>I begin by setting up a Parity DSU to track relative parity between indices. As I iterate through all pairs (i, j), whenever A[i][j] != A[j][i], I compare the two values. If A[i][j] < A[j][i], I want i and j to have the same parity; otherwise, they must differ. Before applying any constraint, I first check if i and j are already connected. If they are, I validate that the required parity aligns with the existing one. If not connected, I safely unify them with the desired parity. This ensures the DSU remains consistent throughout and avoids contradictions. Once the DSU is built correctly, I can determine whether to use A[i][j] or A[j][i] based on parity differences to construct the final lexicographically smallest matrix.</intervene>\\\\nGot it, let's continue refining the approach based on the Partial_Solution's self-criticism.\\\\n<abandon>First, I need to clarify how to handle existing parity constraints when processing (i,j) pairs. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe key fix is: **When processing (i,j) where i < j, we can't always choose the minimal value directly. We first check if i and j are already in the same DSU set. If they are, their parity is fixed\\\\u2014so we have to take the value that aligns with that parity.</abandon><reason>Hmm, I assumed that just comparing parity[i] == parity[j] is always safe for deciding whether to use A[i][j] or A[j][i]. But now I realize that this completely relies on the assumption that the DSU parity structure was correctly formed. And I never actually confirmed that. If any earlier merge had conflicting parity constraints or was applied without verifying consistency, then these parity values could be off \\\\u2014 silently. So even though the logic here looks clean in isolation, it\\\\u2019s sitting on top of a structure that might already be broken. That means my final matrix could be choosing the wrong elements and still appear \\\"valid\\\" \\\\u2014 which is even harder to debug.</reason>\\\\nGot it, let's continue refining the approach based on the Partial_Solution's self-criticism.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I need to clarify how to handle existing parity constraints when processing (i,j) pairs. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe key fix is: **When processing (i,j) where i < j, we can't always choose the minimal value directly.\\\\n<abandon>We first check if i and j are already in the same DSU set.

Even though I\\\\u2019m checking parity during the matrix value decision, I never actually validated that parity propagation across connected components is conflict-free. That\\\\u2019s risky.\\\\n\\\\nThe flaw originates from skipping parity validation during union operations. If two nodes already belong to the same component, the DSU might silently allow conflicting parity merges without any checks. This creates an inconsistent state.\\\\n\\\\nThis inconsistency leaks into the second pass when I rely on parity[i] ^ parity[j] to pick between A[i][j] and A[j][i] \\\\u2014 but if parity isn't built correctly, this logic misfires and leads to incorrect results in matrix B. So even though the reasoning seems clean, the hidden inconsistency in parity propagation ruins the output.</reason>\\\\n<abandon>Got it, let's fix this parity DSU issue first. The DSU with parity (also called a bipartition DSU or DSU with rollback for parity) needs to support two key operations:\\\\\\\\n1. **Find**: Get the root of a node and the parity (distance modulo 2) from the node to the root.\\\\\\\\n2. **Union**: Merge two sets with a required parity constraint (whether the two nodes should be in the same partition or different). If merging would create a contradiction (e.g., nodes are already connected and required parity doesn't match existing), we **cannot** perform the union\\\\u2014this is crucial to avoid invalid states.\\\\n\\\\nWait, but in our problem, do we ever have conflicting constraints?</abandon><reason>Ohh, I assumed that once the DSU gives me a parity for each node, I could just trust it blindly when building the matrix. But wait\\\\u2014that only works if every union was consistent with the required parity in the first place. If I ever tried to merge two nodes that were already connected but with a conflicting parity, I might've silently broken the DSU structure. That means when I later use parity[i] ^ parity[j] to decide between A[i][j] and A[j][i], I could be making the wrong choice entirely. So yeah, even if things look fine on the surface, one bad union early on could mess up the whole result.</reason>\\\\nGot it, let's continue from here.\\\\n<abandon>The core issue identified is ensuring that when processing (i,j) pairs (i < j), we don't force a conflicting parity constraint. We need to first check if i and j are already connected, and if so, validate that our desired parity (based on choosing the minimal value) is compatible. If it's not compatible, we can't choose the minimal value\\\\u2014we have to take the other option.</abandon><reason>Hmm, the step correctly identifies that we shouldn\\\\u2019t blindly apply a union if a parity conflict already exists between i and j. But the flaw lies in how that check is handled. It says we must \\\\u201cvalidate that our desired parity is compatible\\\\u201d after detecting connectivity, but it never clarifies what to do if the parities already clash\\\\u2014besides just saying \\\"we can't choose the minimal value.\\\" That\\\\u2019s vague and underspecified.\\\\n\\\\nThis causes trouble because without a clear fallback when a parity conflict occurs, the logic becomes incomplete. The matrix decision at (i, j) would hang in limbo with no consistent rule guiding it. So the logic feels halfway there but doesn\\\\u2019t give a full path forward when a merge is unsafe.</reason>\\\\nGot it, let's pick up where the self-criticism left off and address the missing pieces. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, let's formalize exactly what to do when processing (i, j) (i < j) with the Parity DSU. The goal is to choose the lex smallest possible value for B[i][j] while respecting existing constraints. Here's the step-by-step logic for this critical part:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor each (i, j) in row-major order (i from 1 to n, j from 1 to n):\\\\\\\\n- If i == j: B[i][j] = A[i][j] (no choice, since swapping doesn't affect diagonal).\\\\\\\\n- If i > j: Skip (since B[i][j] is determined by B[j][i] and parity, as we'll handle later).\\\\\\\\n- If i < j:\\\\\\\\n  1. Get the two possible values: `val_same = A[i][j]` (if parity[i] == parity[j], we use this), `val_diff = A[j][i]` (if parity[i] != parity[j], we use this).\\\\\\\\n  2. We want to choose the lex smallest value possible. So first, check if we can choose the minimal value (min_val = min(val_same, val_diff)) by verifying if the corresponding parity constraint is compatible with existing DSU state.\\\\\\\\n  3. To do this:\\\\\\\\n     a. Check if i and j are connected in the DSU. Let `(connected, existing_parity)` = find_parity(i, j) (existing_parity is 0 if same parity, 1 if different).\\\\\\\\n     b. The desired_parity for min_val is: 0 if min_val == val_same (since same parity gives val_same), 1 if min_val == val_diff (since different parity gives val_diff).\\\\\\\\n     c. If NOT connected: We can safely enforce the desired_parity. Union i and j with the desired_parity constraint. Then set B[i][j] = min_val.\\\\\\\\n     d. If connected: We must respect the existing_parity. So:\\\\\\\\n        - If existing_parity == desired_parity: Great! We can still choose min_val (since it's allowed by existing constraints). Set B[i][j] = min_val.\\\\\\\\n        - If existing_parity != desired_parity: We CAN'T choose min_val (it would violate constraints). So we have to choose the other value (max_val = max(val_same, val_diff)). Set B[i][j] = max_val.\\\\\\\\n  4. After deciding B[i][j], B[j][i] is determined by the parity: If parity[i] == parity[j], B[j][i] = A[j][i] (wait, no\\\\u2014let's think again. Since B[i][j] and B[j][i] are linked by parity:\\\\\\\\n     - If B[i][j] = A[i][j] (same parity), then B[j][i] must be A[j][i] (since same parity for j and i is same as i and j).\\\\\\\\n     - If B[i][j] = A[j][i] (different parity), then B[j][i] must be A[i][j] (since j and i have different parity, so B[j][i] swaps to A[i][j]).\\\\\\\\n     Wait, no\\\\u2014actually, once we have the parity array, B[i][j] is determined as:\\\\\\\\n     B[i][j] = (parity[i] == parity[j]) ? A[i][j] : A[j][i]\\\\\\\\n     Oh right! That's a key simplification I missed earlier. The entire matrix can be built from the parity array. So instead of tracking B[i][j] during processing, we can first compute the parity array (via DSU with constraints), then construct B by applying the parity rule to each cell.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWait, that's a critical correction. The Partial_Solution mentioned building the result matrix using the parity array, but the earlier steps were mixing B matrix construction with DSU constraints.\\\\n<abandon>Let's realign:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe correct flow is:\\\\\\\\n1. **Process all (i, j) pairs in row-major order (i < j) to build the parity constraints**:\\\\\\\\n   For each (i, j) where i < j:\\\\\\\\n   a. Compute val_same = A[i][j], val_diff = A[j][i].\\\\\\\\n   b. We want to choose the lex smallest possible value for B[i][j], which is min(val_same, val_diff), but only if this choice is compatible with existing constraints.\\\\\\\\n   c. To enforce this choice, we need to set the parity between i and j such that B[i][j] = min_val. The required parity is:\\\\\\\\n      - required_parity = 0 if min_val == val_same (since same parity \\\\u2192 use A[i][j])\\\\\\\\n      - required_parity = 1 if min_val == val_diff (since different parity \\\\u2192 use A[j][i])\\\\\\\\n   d. Now, check if i and j are connected in the DSU:\\\\\\\\n      i. If not connected: Union them with the required_parity. This enforces the constraint to get min_val.\\\\\\\\n      ii. If connected: Check if the existing parity between i and j matches required_parity. If it does, great\\\\u2014we can still get min_val. If not, we CAN'T get min_val (we have to take max_val), but we don't need to do anything here (since the parity is fixed, and we'll handle it when building the matrix).\\\\\\\\n   Wait, but why don't we need to do anything? Because even if we can't get min_val for (i,j), the parity is already fixed by earlier constraints. So when we build the matrix, we'll just have to use whatever value the parity dictates.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. **Build the result matrix using the parity array**:\\\\\\\\n   For each cell (i, j):\\\\\\\\n   a. If parity[i] == parity[j], B[i][j] = A[i][j]\\\\\\\\n   b. Else, B[i][j] = A[j][i]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAh! That's a key insight I missed earlier. The matrix construction is a direct function of the parity array. So we don't need to track B during DSU processing\\\\u2014we just need to compute the parity array correctly (prioritizing lex smallest choices where possible), then generate B from it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis simplifies the problem: our only job during processing is to set up the parity constraints in a way that, when we build B from parity, the matrix is lex smallest possible.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, let's rephrase the processing step with this in mind.</abandon><reason>Umm, I assumed that it\\\\u2019s safe to use the current parity values from DSU to decide whether B[i][j] = A[i][j] or A[j][i] while still in the process of constructing the union structure.\\\\n\\\\nBut this is flawed. The DSU\\\\u2019s parity information isn't stable until all relevant unions have been performed. Relying on it mid-way means I might be basing decisions on incomplete or even incorrect parity relationships \\\\u2014 especially if some unite() calls are yet to happen that could flip the structure.\\\\n\\\\nThis causes my matrix construction to go off-track. Since B[i][j] values are finalized too early based on unreliable parity, the resulting matrix can violate both consistency and lexicographical minimality.</reason>\\\\nGot it, let's address the critical flaw pointed out: we can't rely on the parity array mid-processing to build the matrix. Instead, we need to first finalize all parity constraints (using DSU with row-major prioritization for lex order), then construct the matrix in one pass using the final parity array. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, let's clarify the Parity DSU (also called a \\\\\\\\\\\"Union-Find with Bipartition\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\"DSU for bipartite graphs\\\\\\\\\\\").\\\\nIt tracks for each node its parent and a \\\\\\\\\\\"color\\\\\\\\\\\" (0 or 1) representing the parity relative to the parent. The find function returns both the root of the set and the parity from the node to the root.\\\\nWhen uniting two nodes, we check if they are in the same set and whether the required parity is compatible.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Key Fixes to the Approach\\\\\\\\n1. **Process all (i, j) in row-major order (i < j) to enforce lex constraints first**:\\\\\\\\n   - For each (i, j) where i < j (since (i, j) comes before (j, i) in row-major order), we want to choose the smallest possible value for B[i][j] (which is min(A[i][j], A[j][i])) **if possible**. \\\\\\\\n   - To choose this value, we need to enforce a parity constraint between i and j:\\\\\\\\n     - If min_val is A[i][j], then i and j must have the same parity (since B[i][j] = A[i][j] when parity[i] == parity[j]).\\\\\\\\n     - If min_val is A[j][i], then i and j must have different parity (since B[i][j] = A[j][i] when parity[i] != parity[j]).\\\\\\\\n   - We use the Parity DSU to enforce this constraint **only if it doesn't conflict with existing constraints**.\\\\nIf it does conflict (i and j are already connected with the opposite parity), we can't choose the min_val\\\\u2014we have to accept the max_val, but we do nothing here (the parity is fixed, so the matrix construction will handle it later).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. **Construct the matrix after finalizing all parity constraints**:\\\\\\\\n   - Once all constraints are processed, for each cell (i, j), compute B[i][j] as:\\\\\\\\n     - If parity[i] == parity[j] (relative to the DSU root), use A[i][j].\\\\\\\\n     - Else, use A[j][i].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Detailed Parity DSU Implementation\\\\\\\\nThe DSU needs two arrays:\\\\\\\\n- `parent[]`: Tracks the parent of each node.\\\\\\\\n- `rank[]`: For union by rank (to keep the tree shallow).\\\\\\\\n- `color[]`: Tracks the parity (0 or 1) from the node to its parent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `find` function returns a pair (root, parity_from_node_to_root).\\\\nIt uses path compression to update the parent and color arrays for efficiency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `unite` function takes two nodes `u` and `v` and a required parity (0 if u and v should have the same parity, 1 if different). It checks if they are in the same set:\\\\\\\\n- If not, it merges the smaller set into the larger one and updates the color array to maintain the required parity.\\\\\\\\n- If they are, it checks if the existing parity matches the required parity.\\\\nIf not, it's a conflict (but in our problem, we only call `unite` when there's no conflict, since we check first).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Step-by-Step Processing for Each (i, j) (i < j)\\\\\\\\nFor each (i, j) in row-major order (i from 0 to n-1, j from i+1 to n-1\\\\u2014using 0-based indices for easier array handling):\\\\\\\\n1.\\\\nGet `val_same = A[i][j]` (value if i and j have same parity).\\\\\\\\n2. Get `val_diff = A[j][i]` (value if i and j have different parity).\\\\\\\\n3. Determine `min_val = min(val_same, val_diff)` and `required_parity`:\\\\\\\\n   - If `min_val == val_same`, `required_parity = 0` (same parity).\\\\\\\\n   - Else, `required_parity = 1` (different parity).\\\\\\\\n4. Use the DSU to find the roots and parities of `i` and `j`:\\\\\\\\n   - `(root_i, parity_i) = find(i)`\\\\\\\\n   - `(root_j, parity_j) = find(j)`\\\\\\\\n5. If `root_i != root_j`:\\\\\\\\n   - We can safely unite `i` and `j` with the required parity. The parity between `i` and `j` should be `required_parity`, which translates to:\\\\\\\\n     - The parity from `i` to `j` is `parity_i XOR desired_parity_between_i_and_j XOR parity_j`? Wait, let's derive it correctly.\\\\\\\\n     - The parity between `i` and `j` is `parity_i XOR parity_j` (since parity_i is i to root, parity_j is j to root\\\\u2014if root is same, XOR gives i to j). But if roots are different, we need to set the parity between `i` and `j` to `required_parity`. So:\\\\\\\\n     - When uniting `root_i` and `root_j`, the color of `root_i` (relative to `root_j`) should be `parity_i XOR required_parity XOR parity_j`. This ensures that after uniting, the parity between `i` and `j` is `required_parity`.\\\\\\\\n   - Call `unite(i, j, required_parity)`.\\\\\\\\n6.\\\\nIf `root_i == root_j`:\\\\\\\\n   - Check if the existing parity between `i` and `j` (which is `parity_i XOR parity_j`) matches `required_parity`.\\\\\\\\n   - If it does: Great\\\\u2014we can still get `min_val` for B[i][j].\\\\\\\\n   - If it doesn't: We can't get `min_val`\\\\u2014we have to take `max_val`, but we do nothing here (the parity is fixed, so the matrix construction will use the correct value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Matrix Construction\\\\\\\\nAfter processing all (i, j) pairs, for each cell (i, j):\\\\\\\\n1.\\\\nFind the parity of `i` and `j` relative to their root (using `find`\\\\u2014but since we only need the parity between `i` and `j`, we can compute it as `(find(i).second XOR find(j).second)`).\\\\\\\\n2. If the parity is 0 (same), set B[i][j] = A[i][j].\\\\\\\\n3. Else, set B[i][j] = A[j][i].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Why This Works\\\\\\\\n- By processing (i, j) in row-major order, we prioritize earlier cells (which have higher lex importance) to take their minimal possible value first. \\\\\\\\n- The DSU ensures that all constraints are consistent\\\\u2014we never force a conflicting constraint. \\\\\\\\n- The matrix construction is a direct function of the final parity array, which captures all the constraints needed to get the lex smallest matrix.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Handling 0-Based vs 1-Based Indices\\\\\\\\nThe problem statement uses 1-based indices for rows and columns, but in code, it's easier to use 0-based.\\\\nWe'll adjust the input to 0-based arrays.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Edge Cases\\\\\\\\n- n = 1: The matrix has only one element\\\\u2014no operations possible, so output it as-is.\\\\\\\\n- A[i][j] == A[j][i]: No choice needed\\\\u2014both values are the same, so parity constraint doesn't matter.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Time Complexity\\\\\\\\n- For each test case:\\\\\\\\n  - DSU operations (find and unite) are nearly O(1) per operation (amortized).\\\\\\\\n  - Processing all (i, j) pairs: O(n\\\\xb2) per test case (since i < j, it's O(n\\\\xb2/2) operations).\\\\\\\\n  - Constructing the matrix: O(n\\\\xb2) per test case.\\\\\\\\n- Since the sum of n\\\\xb2 over all test cases is \\\\u2264 1e6, this is efficient.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### C++ Implementation Steps\\\\\\\\n1.\\\\n<abandon>Read t test cases.\\\\\\\\n2.

Output the result matrix.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Parity DSU Code\\\\\\\\nImplement the DSU with path compression and union by rank.</abandon><reason>Oh no, I assumed it was safe to call dsu.unite(i, j, required_parity) for every pair (i, j) based on whether A[i][j] or A[j][i] was smaller\\\\u2014without first checking if i and j already belonged to the same set and whether their existing parity matched the required one.\\\\n\\\\nThis assumption is flawed. The DSU with parity constraints maintains logical consistency only if we explicitly verify that existing parity relationships are compatible before merging. If i and j are already connected but with a different parity than what the current min_val demands, directly uniting them introduces a contradiction in the DSU's internal structure.\\\\n\\\\nThis mistake breaks the matrix construction in subtle ways: we might incorrectly assume we can place the minimum value min(A[i][j], A[j][i]) in B[i][j], even though the underlying parity relationship doesn\\\\u2019t support it. As a result, the final matrix can violate either the parity logic or the lexicographical ordering constraint.</reason>\\\\n<abandon>Got it, let's address the critical mistake pointed out in the self-criticism: **we must check for parity compatibility before attempting to unite nodes in the DSU**. The previous approach skipped this check, which could lead to invalid DSU states and incorrect matrix construction. Here's the revised, correct reasoning and implementation plan:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Critical Fix: Validate Parity Compatibility Before Uniting\\\\\\\\nWhen processing (i, j) (i < j), we can't just unite i and j with the required parity\\\\u2014we first need to check if they are already connected. If they are, we must verify that their existing parity matches the required parity for the minimal value. If it doesn't, we **can't** choose the minimal value (we have to take the other value), and we do **not** perform any DSU operation (since it would create a conflict).</abandon><reason>Hmm, I assumed that by checking if (root_i == root_j && existing_parity != required_parity) and skipping the union in such cases, I was preserving correctness. That part is fine. But I overlooked a more fundamental modeling issue: I tried to enforce the minimal value (between A[i][j] and A[j][i]) even when the values are equal\\\\u2014leading to unnecessary parity constraints.\\\\n\\\\nThis assumption is flawed. If A[i][j] == A[j][i], there's no need to enforce any parity constraint since both values are the same regardless of the parity between i and j. Forcing a union here can accidentally restrict future choices by unnecessarily fixing the parity between unrelated nodes. This subtle oversight can cascade into incorrect behavior later, especially when earlier constraints prevent selecting the correct value in later cells due to premature unions.\\\\n\\\\nThis flaw leads to failure by introducing spurious parity links, which can later conflict with real constraints that arise when unequal values are encountered. It breaks the matrix construction by biasing parity relations that shouldn't be fixed at all, reducing flexibility.</reason>\\\\nGot it, let's address the remaining flaws and finalize the correct approach. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, we need to fix the mistake of enforcing parity constraints when A[i][j] == A[j][i]. When the values are equal, there's no need to link i and j\\\\u2014any parity between them is acceptable, so we should skip DSU operations for these pairs.\\\\nThis preserves flexibility for future constraints where values are unequal.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Revised Approach with Key Fixes\\\\\\\\nLet's restate the core steps with all corrections:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### 1. Parity DSU (Union-Find with Bipartition)\\\\\\\\nWe use a DSU that tracks:\\\\\\\\n- `parent[]`: Parent of each node (0-based).\\\\\\\\n- `rank[]`: For union by rank (to keep the tree balanced).\\\\\\\\n- `color[]`: The parity (0 or 1) from the node to its parent (0 = same parity as parent, 1 = different).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `find` function returns a pair `(root, parity_from_node_to_root)` and uses path compression to update `parent` and `color` for efficiency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `unite` function takes two nodes `u` and `v` and a required parity `req` (0 = same parity between u and v, 1 = different). It:\\\\\\\\n- Finds roots and parities for `u` and `v`.\\\\\\\\n- If roots are different: Merges the smaller tree into the larger one, adjusting `color` to maintain the required parity between `u` and `v`.\\\\\\\\n- If roots are the same: Checks if the existing parity (parity_u XOR parity_v) matches `req`. If not, it's a conflict (but we avoid this by checking before calling `unite`).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### 2.\\\\nProcessing Pairs (i, j) for Constraints\\\\\\\\nFor each test case:\\\\\\\\n- Read the matrix (0-based).\\\\\\\\n- Initialize DSU for nodes 0 to n-1.\\\\\\\\n- Iterate over all pairs (i, j) **in row-major order** (i from 0 to n-1, j from 0 to n-1):\\\\\\\\n  - Skip if `i >= j` (since (i, j) is processed after (j, i) in row-major? No\\\\u2014wait, row-major order is (0,0) \\\\u2192 (0,1) \\\\u2192 ... \\\\u2192 (0,n-1) \\\\u2192 (1,0) \\\\u2192 ... \\\\u2192 (n-1,n-1). So (i, j) comes before (i', j') if `i < i'` or `i == i'` and `j < j'`. For lex order, we need to prioritize cells that appear earlier in this sequence. However, since (i, j) and (j, i) are linked, we should process **only (i, j) where i < j** (to avoid redundant processing), but **in the order of their appearance in row-major order** (i.e., (0,1) before (0,2), which comes before (1,0), etc.). Wait, no\\\\u2014row-major order for all cells includes (0,1) (position 1) before (1,0) (position n). Since (0,1) is lex earlier than (1,0), we need to process (0,1) first to ensure its minimal value is chosen before (1,0) is considered. But (i, j) where i < j may not be in row-major order relative to (i', j') where i' > j'. For example, (0,1) (row 0, column 1) is before (1,0) (row 1, column 0) in row-major order. So we need to iterate over all cells **in row-major order**, and for each cell (i, j):\\\\\\\\n    - If `i == j`: Skip (no choice).\\\\\\\\n    - If `i > j`: Skip (since we already processed (j, i) if it was earlier in row-major order? No\\\\u2014wait, (j, i) may be later. For example, (1,0) is row 1, column 0\\\\u2014(0,1) is earlier. So to process cells in lex order (row-major), we need to handle each cell (i, j) in that order, but for (i, j) where i != j, we only apply constraints when (i, j) is the **first occurrence** of the pair (i, j) or (j, i) in row-major order. Wait, no\\\\u2014this is getting confusing.\\\\nLet's clarify with lex order:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe lex order of cells is determined by their linear index `pos = i * n + j`. For two cells (a, b) and (c, d), (a, b) comes before (c, d) if `a * n + b < c * n + d`. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor a pair (i, j) where i != j, the two cells (i, j) and (j, i) have positions `p1 = i*n + j` and `p2 = j*n + i`. We need to process the **cell with the smaller position first** (since it's lex earlier) to ensure that we choose the minimal value for that cell before any constraints from the other cell are applied. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example:\\\\\\\\n- (0,1) has position 1, (1,0) has position n. If n > 1, 1 < n \\\\u2192 process (0,1) first.\\\\\\\\n- (1,2) has position n + 2, (2,1) has position 2n + 1. Which is smaller depends on n. For n=3: 1*3+2=5 vs 2*3+1=7 \\\\u2192 5 is smaller. For n=4: 1*4+2=6 vs 2*4+1=9 \\\\u2192 6 is smaller. Ah, yes\\\\u2014for any n > 2, (i, j) where i < j has position `i*n + j` < `j*n + i` (since i < j \\\\u2192 i*n + j < j*n + i \\\\u2192 j - i < n(j - i) \\\\u2192 true for n > 1). Wait, let's prove it:\\\\\\\\n  `i*n + j < j*n + i`  \\\\\\\\n  \\\\u2192 `i*n - i < j*n - j`  \\\\\\\\n  \\\\u2192 `i(n - 1) < j(n - 1)`  \\\\\\\\n  Since n > 1 (n=1 is trivial), this is true if and only if `i < j`. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAh! So for n > 1, (i, j) with `i < j` comes before (j, i) in row-major order. For n=1, there's only one cell. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is a key insight.\\\\nSo to process cells in lex order, we only need to iterate over all pairs (i, j) where `i < j` (since they are the lex earlier cells of their pairs), and process them in row-major order (which for i < j is equivalent to iterating i from 0 to n-1, j from i+1 to n-1). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo the corrected processing step for constraints is:\\\\\\\\n- For each test case:\\\\\\\\n  - Read matrix A (0-based).\\\\\\\\n  - Initialize DSU.\\\\\\\\n  - Iterate i from 0 to n-1:\\\\\\\\n    - Iterate j from i+1 to n-1:\\\\\\\\n      - Get `pos = i * n + j` (though we don't need it explicitly\\\\u2014since i < j, this is the lex earlier cell of the pair).\\\\\\\\n      - `val_same = A[i][j]` (value if i and j have same parity).\\\\\\\\n      - `val_diff = A[j][i]` (value if i and j have different parity).\\\\\\\\n      - If `val_same == val_diff`: Skip (no constraint needed\\\\u2014both values are same, so parity doesn't matter).\\\\\\\\n      - Else:\\\\\\\\n        - We want to choose the minimal value for the lex earlier cell (i, j). So `min_val = min(val_same, val_diff)`.\\\\\\\\n        - `required_parity` is 0 if `min_val == val_same` (same parity), 1 if `min_val == val_diff` (different parity).\\\\\\\\n        - Now, check if we can enforce this `required_parity` between i and j using DSU:\\\\\\\\n          - `(root_i, parity_i) = find(i)`.\\\\\\\\n          - `(root_j, parity_j) = find(j)`.\\\\\\\\n          - If `root_i != root_j`:\\\\\\\\n            - We can safely unite i and j with the `required_parity` (since no existing constraint).

This avoids creating unnecessary parity constraints, preserving flexibility for future pairs where values are unequal. This is critical\\\\u2014unnecessary unions could force conflicting constraints later, leading to incorrect matrix values.\\\\\\\\n- **Processing Lex Earlier Cells First**: By iterating over (i, j) where `i < j` (lex earlier cells), we prioritize choosing the minimal value for these cells first, which is essential for lex order.\\\\\\\\n- **Checking Parity Compatibility**: Before uniting, we check if i and j are already connected. If they are, we only proceed if the existing parity allows the minimal value. If not, we accept the non-minimal value (since we can't violate constraints).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### C++ Implementation Details\\\\\\\\nNow, let's translate this into code.\\\\nWe need to:\\\\\\\\n- Implement the Parity DSU with path compression and union by rank.\\\\\\\\n- For each test case:\\\\\\\\n  - Read n and the matrix.\\\\\\\\n  - Process all (i, j) pairs where `i < j` and `A[i][j] != A[j][i]` to enforce constraints.\\\\\\\\n  - Build the result matrix using the final parity information.\\\\\\\\n  - Output the result.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Parity DSU Code\\\\\\\\n```cpp\\\\\\\\nstruct ParityDSU {\\\\\\\\n    vector<int> parent;\\\\\\\\n    vector<int> rank;\\\\\\\\n    vector<int> color; // 0: same parity as parent, 1: different\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    ParityDSU(int n) {\\\\\\\\n        parent.resize(n);\\\\\\\\n        rank.resize(n, 0);\\\\\\\\n        color.resize(n, 0);\\\\\\\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\\\\\\\\n            parent[i] = i;\\\\\\\\n        }\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    pair<int, int> find(int u) {\\\\\\\\n        if (parent[u] != u) {\\\\\\\\n            auto [root, c] = find(parent[u]);\\\\\\\\n            parent[u] = root;\\\\\\\\n            color[u] ^= c;\\\\\\\\n        }\\\\\\\\n        return {parent[u], color[u]};\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    bool unite(int u, int v, int req) {\\\\\\\\n        // req is 0 if u and v should have same parity, 1 if different\\\\\\\\n        auto [root_u, cu] = find(u);\\\\\\\\n        auto [root_v, cv] = find(v);\\\\\\\\n        if (root_u == root_v) {\\\\\\\\n            // Check if existing parity matches req\\\\\\\\n            return (cu ^ cv) == req;\\\\\\\\n        }\\\\\\\\n        // Union by rank\\\\\\\\n        if (rank[root_u] < rank[root_v]) {\\\\\\\\n            swap(root_u, root_v);\\\\\\\\n            swap(cu, cv);\\\\\\\\n            swap(u, v);\\\\\\\\n        }\\\\\\\\n        parent[root_v] = root_u;\\\\\\\\n        // We want (cu ^ color[root_v] ^ cv) == req\\\\\\\\n        // Because: parity(u to root_u) is cu, parity(v to root_v) is cv.\\\\\\\\n        // After union, parity(v to root_u) is color[root_v] ^ cv.\\\\\\\\n        // We want parity(u to v) = req \\\\u2192 cu ^ (color[root_v] ^ cv) = req \\\\u2192 color[root_v] = cu ^ cv ^ req.\\\\\\\\n        color[root_v] = cu ^ cv ^ req;\\\\\\\\n        if (rank[root_u] == rank[root_v]) {\\\\\\\\n            rank[root_u]++;\\\\\\\\n        }\\\\\\\\n        return true;\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n};\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Main Function Logic\\\\\\\\nFor each test case:\\\\\\\\n```cpp\\\\\\\\nint t;\\\\\\\\ncin >> t;\\\\\\\\nwhile (t--) {\\\\\\\\n    int n;\\\\\\\\n    cin >> n;\\\\\\\\n    vector<vector<long long>> A(n, vector<long long>(n));\\\\\\\\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\\\\\\\\n        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {\\\\\\\\n            cin >> A[i][j];\\\\\\\\n        }\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    if (n == 1) {\\\\\\\\n        // No operations possible\\\\\\\\n        cout << A[0][0] << endl;\\\\\\\\n        continue;\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    ParityDSU dsu(n);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    // Process all (i, j) with i < j (lex earlier cells)\\\\\\\\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\\\\\\\\n        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {\\\\\\\\n            long long val_same = A[i][j];\\\\\\\\n            long long val_diff = A[j][i];\\\\\\\\n            if (val_same == val_diff) {\\\\\\\\n                continue; // No constraint needed\\\\\\\\n            }\\\\\\\\n            long long min_val = min(val_same, val_diff);\\\\\\\\n            int req = (min_val == val_same) ?

The `find` function uses path compression to keep operations efficient, while the `unite` function merges sets and maintains parity constraints.\\\\n2. **Constraint Processing**: For each pair (i, j) where i < j, we check if the values at (i, j) and (j, i) are different. If so, we determine the required parity to choose the smaller value and update the DSU if possible.\\\\n3. **Matrix Construction**: Using the final parity information from the DSU, we construct the result matrix. For each cell (i, j), we use the parity of i and j to decide whether to keep the original value or swap with (j, i), ensuring the lexicographically smallest result.\\\\n\\\\nThis approach efficiently handles up to the maximum constraints, ensuring correctness and optimal performance for large inputs.\",\n",

First, I need to remember the key insight from similar problems: each swap operation on k allows us to choose whether the k-th row is the original row or the original column. But since swapping k affects both row k and column k, we need to model dependencies between indices using a parity DSU (Union-Find with bipartition) to track whether two indices must have the same or opposite parity (swap state).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWait, let's go back to the problem's core.\\\\nThe operation swaps row k with column k. Let's think about what this means for the final matrix.\\\\nFor any cell (i, j), after some swaps, its value can be either A[i][j] or A[j][i], but with constraints: if (i, j) uses A[j][i], then (j, i) must use A[i][j], and vice versa. Also, for cells (i, k) and (k, j), the choices must be consistent (e.g., if i and k have a parity constraint, and k and j have another, then i and j's constraint is determined).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe correct approach, as per competitive programming solutions for similar problems (like matrix lex smallest with swap constraints), is:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Model Constraints**: For each pair (i, j), if we decide that the final cell (i, j) should be the minimum of A[i][j] and A[j][i], we need to enforce the corresponding parity constraint (same or different) between i and j.\\\\nHowever, we must process these constraints in a way that ensures global consistency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWait, no\\\\u2014actually, the correct way is to realize that the matrix elements form a graph where each cell (i, j) (i < j) connects i and j with an edge that has a \\\\\\\\\\\"preference\\\\\\\\\\\" (whether we want i and j to have the same or different parity to get the minimum value).\\\\nBut since we need lex smallest, we process cells in row-major order, and for each cell (i, j), we make the minimal choice possible given the current constraints.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBut let's look at the sample input 1:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOriginal matrix:\\\\\\\\n2 1 2\\\\\\\\n2 1 2\\\\\\\\n1 1 2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSample output:\\\\\\\\n2 1 1\\\\\\\\n2 1 1\\\\\\\\n2 2 2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet's see cell (1,3): original A[1][3] is 2, A[3][1] is 1. To get the minimal value (1), we need to swap row 3 (so that (1,3) takes A[3][1]). Which aligns with the sample operation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAh, right! So for cell (i, j), if we want B[i][j] to be the minimum of A[i][j] and A[j][i], we need to set the parity of i and j such that:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- If min_val is A[i][j], then parity[i] == parity[j] (since B[i][j] = A[i][j] when same parity).\\\\\\\\n- If min_val is A[j][i], then parity[i] != parity[j] (since B[i][j] = A[j][i] when different parity).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBut we must ensure that these choices are consistent across the matrix.\\\\nFor example, if we choose parity[i] != parity[j] for cell (i, j), then for cell (j, k), our choice must not contradict this.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo the steps are:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Parity DSU**: Use a DSU that tracks the parity (relative to root) for each node.\\\\nThis allows us to check if a constraint (same or different parity) between two nodes is possible.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. **Process Cells in Row-Major Order**: For each cell (i, j) in row-major order (from (1,1) to (n,n)):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   a. If i == j: B[i][j] = A[i][j] (since parity[i] == parity[i] always).\\\\\\\\n   b. If i > j: B[i][j] is determined by B[j][i] and the parity of i and j. Specifically, if parity[i] == parity[j], then B[i][j] = A[i][j]; else, B[i][j] = A[j][i]. But wait, no\\\\u2014since (i, j) is the transpose of (j, i), once we process (j, i), (i, j) is determined. So we can skip processing (i, j) when i > j.\\\\\\\\n   c.\\\\nIf i < j: We want to choose B[i][j] to be the minimal possible value (min(A[i][j], A[j][i])), but only if this choice is consistent with existing constraints. If it's not, we have to take the other value. Then, we enforce the corresponding constraint (same or different parity) between i and j using the DSU.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. **Build the Result Matrix**: After determining all parity constraints, construct the result matrix using the parity array.\\\\nThe current implementation here doesn't handle the scenario correctly when two indices (i and j) are already connected in the same set in the DSU, and their parity is fixed. The logic assumes that once we determine the parity between two indices, we can freely select the minimal value (val0 or val1) from the pair (A[i][j], A[j][i]). However, when i and j are already united in the same set, their parity is already determined by the previous unions, and we must respect this established parity.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, if during the processing of cell (i, j) we select val0 based on the lexicographically smallest value but the existing parity between i and j contradicts this selection, we must instead choose val1. Failing to respect this parity constraint could result in an incorrect matrix.\\\\n\\\\nThe current implementation doesn't account for these conflicts when i and j are in the same component (set) and may select an invalid minimal value, which leads to incorrect results.\\\\nI begin by setting up a Parity DSU to track relative parity between indices. As I iterate through all pairs (i, j), whenever A[i][j] != A[j][i], I compare the two values. If A[i][j] < A[j][i], I want i and j to have the same parity; otherwise, they must differ. Before applying any constraint, I first check if i and j are already connected. If they are, I validate that the required parity aligns with the existing one. If not connected, I safely unify them with the desired parity. This ensures the DSU remains consistent throughout and avoids contradictions. Once the DSU is built correctly, I can determine whether to use A[i][j] or A[j][i] based on parity differences to construct the final lexicographically smallest matrix.\\\\n\\\"Got it, let's continue refining the approach based on the Partial_Solution's self-criticism.\\\\n\\\"Got it, let's continue refining the approach based on the Partial_Solution's self-criticism.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I need to clarify how to handle existing parity constraints when processing (i,j) pairs. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe key fix is: **When processing (i,j) where i < j, we can't always choose the minimal value directly.\\\\n\\\"Got it, let's continue from here.\\\\n\\\"Got it, let's pick up where the self-criticism left off and address the missing pieces. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, let's formalize exactly what to do when processing (i, j) (i < j) with the Parity DSU. The goal is to choose the lex smallest possible value for B[i][j] while respecting existing constraints. Here's the step-by-step logic for this critical part:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor each (i, j) in row-major order (i from 1 to n, j from 1 to n):\\\\\\\\n- If i == j: B[i][j] = A[i][j] (no choice, since swapping doesn't affect diagonal).\\\\\\\\n- If i > j: Skip (since B[i][j] is determined by B[j][i] and parity, as we'll handle later).\\\\\\\\n- If i < j:\\\\\\\\n  1. Get the two possible values: `val_same = A[i][j]` (if parity[i] == parity[j], we use this), `val_diff = A[j][i]` (if parity[i] != parity[j], we use this).\\\\\\\\n  2. We want to choose the lex smallest value possible. So first, check if we can choose the minimal value (min_val = min(val_same, val_diff)) by verifying if the corresponding parity constraint is compatible with existing DSU state.\\\\\\\\n  3. To do this:\\\\\\\\n     a. Check if i and j are connected in the DSU. Let `(connected, existing_parity)` = find_parity(i, j) (existing_parity is 0 if same parity, 1 if different).\\\\\\\\n     b. The desired_parity for min_val is: 0 if min_val == val_same (since same parity gives val_same), 1 if min_val == val_diff (since different parity gives val_diff).\\\\\\\\n     c. If NOT connected: We can safely enforce the desired_parity. Union i and j with the desired_parity constraint. Then set B[i][j] = min_val.\\\\\\\\n     d. If connected: We must respect the existing_parity. So:\\\\\\\\n        - If existing_parity == desired_parity: Great! We can still choose min_val (since it's allowed by existing constraints). Set B[i][j] = min_val.\\\\\\\\n        - If existing_parity != desired_parity: We CAN'T choose min_val (it would violate constraints). So we have to choose the other value (max_val = max(val_same, val_diff)). Set B[i][j] = max_val.\\\\\\\\n  4. After deciding B[i][j], B[j][i] is determined by the parity: If parity[i] == parity[j], B[j][i] = A[j][i] (wait, no\\\\u2014let's think again. Since B[i][j] and B[j][i] are linked by parity:\\\\\\\\n     - If B[i][j] = A[i][j] (same parity), then B[j][i] must be A[j][i] (since same parity for j and i is same as i and j).\\\\\\\\n     - If B[i][j] = A[j][i] (different parity), then B[j][i] must be A[i][j] (since j and i have different parity, so B[j][i] swaps to A[i][j]).\\\\\\\\n     Wait, no\\\\u2014actually, once we have the parity array, B[i][j] is determined as:\\\\\\\\n     B[i][j] = (parity[i] == parity[j]) ? A[i][j] : A[j][i]\\\\\\\\n     Oh right! That's a key simplification I missed earlier. The entire matrix can be built from the parity array. So instead of tracking B[i][j] during processing, we can first compute the parity array (via DSU with constraints), then construct B by applying the parity rule to each cell.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWait, that's a critical correction. The Partial_Solution mentioned building the result matrix using the parity array, but the earlier steps were mixing B matrix construction with DSU constraints.\\\\n\\\"Got it, let's address the critical flaw pointed out: we can't rely on the parity array mid-processing to build the matrix. Instead, we need to first finalize all parity constraints (using DSU with row-major prioritization for lex order), then construct the matrix in one pass using the final parity array. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, let's clarify the Parity DSU (also called a \\\\\\\\\\\"Union-Find with Bipartition\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\"DSU for bipartite graphs\\\\\\\\\\\").\\\\nIt tracks for each node its parent and a \\\\\\\\\\\"color\\\\\\\\\\\" (0 or 1) representing the parity relative to the parent. The find function returns both the root of the set and the parity from the node to the root.\\\\nWhen uniting two nodes, we check if they are in the same set and whether the required parity is compatible.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Key Fixes to the Approach\\\\\\\\n1. **Process all (i, j) in row-major order (i < j) to enforce lex constraints first**:\\\\\\\\n   - For each (i, j) where i < j (since (i, j) comes before (j, i) in row-major order), we want to choose the smallest possible value for B[i][j] (which is min(A[i][j], A[j][i])) **if possible**. \\\\\\\\n   - To choose this value, we need to enforce a parity constraint between i and j:\\\\\\\\n     - If min_val is A[i][j], then i and j must have the same parity (since B[i][j] = A[i][j] when parity[i] == parity[j]).\\\\\\\\n     - If min_val is A[j][i], then i and j must have different parity (since B[i][j] = A[j][i] when parity[i] != parity[j]).\\\\\\\\n   - We use the Parity DSU to enforce this constraint **only if it doesn't conflict with existing constraints**.\\\\nIf it does conflict (i and j are already connected with the opposite parity), we can't choose the min_val\\\\u2014we have to accept the max_val, but we do nothing here (the parity is fixed, so the matrix construction will handle it later).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. **Construct the matrix after finalizing all parity constraints**:\\\\\\\\n   - Once all constraints are processed, for each cell (i, j), compute B[i][j] as:\\\\\\\\n     - If parity[i] == parity[j] (relative to the DSU root), use A[i][j].\\\\\\\\n     - Else, use A[j][i].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Detailed Parity DSU Implementation\\\\\\\\nThe DSU needs two arrays:\\\\\\\\n- `parent[]`: Tracks the parent of each node.\\\\\\\\n- `rank[]`: For union by rank (to keep the tree shallow).\\\\\\\\n- `color[]`: Tracks the parity (0 or 1) from the node to its parent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `find` function returns a pair (root, parity_from_node_to_root).\\\\nIt uses path compression to update the parent and color arrays for efficiency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `unite` function takes two nodes `u` and `v` and a required parity (0 if u and v should have the same parity, 1 if different). It checks if they are in the same set:\\\\\\\\n- If not, it merges the smaller set into the larger one and updates the color array to maintain the required parity.\\\\\\\\n- If they are, it checks if the existing parity matches the required parity.\\\\nIf not, it's a conflict (but in our problem, we only call `unite` when there's no conflict, since we check first).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Step-by-Step Processing for Each (i, j) (i < j)\\\\\\\\nFor each (i, j) in row-major order (i from 0 to n-1, j from i+1 to n-1\\\\u2014using 0-based indices for easier array handling):\\\\\\\\n1.\\\\nGet `val_same = A[i][j]` (value if i and j have same parity).\\\\\\\\n2. Get `val_diff = A[j][i]` (value if i and j have different parity).\\\\\\\\n3. Determine `min_val = min(val_same, val_diff)` and `required_parity`:\\\\\\\\n   - If `min_val == val_same`, `required_parity = 0` (same parity).\\\\\\\\n   - Else, `required_parity = 1` (different parity).\\\\\\\\n4. Use the DSU to find the roots and parities of `i` and `j`:\\\\\\\\n   - `(root_i, parity_i) = find(i)`\\\\\\\\n   - `(root_j, parity_j) = find(j)`\\\\\\\\n5. If `root_i != root_j`:\\\\\\\\n   - We can safely unite `i` and `j` with the required parity. The parity between `i` and `j` should be `required_parity`, which translates to:\\\\\\\\n     - The parity from `i` to `j` is `parity_i XOR desired_parity_between_i_and_j XOR parity_j`? Wait, let's derive it correctly.\\\\\\\\n     - The parity between `i` and `j` is `parity_i XOR parity_j` (since parity_i is i to root, parity_j is j to root\\\\u2014if root is same, XOR gives i to j). But if roots are different, we need to set the parity between `i` and `j` to `required_parity`. So:\\\\\\\\n     - When uniting `root_i` and `root_j`, the color of `root_i` (relative to `root_j`) should be `parity_i XOR required_parity XOR parity_j`. This ensures that after uniting, the parity between `i` and `j` is `required_parity`.\\\\\\\\n   - Call `unite(i, j, required_parity)`.\\\\\\\\n6.\\\\nIf `root_i == root_j`:\\\\\\\\n   - Check if the existing parity between `i` and `j` (which is `parity_i XOR parity_j`) matches `required_parity`.\\\\\\\\n   - If it does: Great\\\\u2014we can still get `min_val` for B[i][j].\\\\\\\\n   - If it doesn't: We can't get `min_val`\\\\u2014we have to take `max_val`, but we do nothing here (the parity is fixed, so the matrix construction will use the correct value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Matrix Construction\\\\\\\\nAfter processing all (i, j) pairs, for each cell (i, j):\\\\\\\\n1.\\\\nFind the parity of `i` and `j` relative to their root (using `find`\\\\u2014but since we only need the parity between `i` and `j`, we can compute it as `(find(i).second XOR find(j).second)`).\\\\\\\\n2. If the parity is 0 (same), set B[i][j] = A[i][j].\\\\\\\\n3. Else, set B[i][j] = A[j][i].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Why This Works\\\\\\\\n- By processing (i, j) in row-major order, we prioritize earlier cells (which have higher lex importance) to take their minimal possible value first. \\\\\\\\n- The DSU ensures that all constraints are consistent\\\\u2014we never force a conflicting constraint. \\\\\\\\n- The matrix construction is a direct function of the final parity array, which captures all the constraints needed to get the lex smallest matrix.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Handling 0-Based vs 1-Based Indices\\\\\\\\nThe problem statement uses 1-based indices for rows and columns, but in code, it's easier to use 0-based.\\\\nWe'll adjust the input to 0-based arrays.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Edge Cases\\\\\\\\n- n = 1: The matrix has only one element\\\\u2014no operations possible, so output it as-is.\\\\\\\\n- A[i][j] == A[j][i]: No choice needed\\\\u2014both values are the same, so parity constraint doesn't matter.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Time Complexity\\\\\\\\n- For each test case:\\\\\\\\n  - DSU operations (find and unite) are nearly O(1) per operation (amortized).\\\\\\\\n  - Processing all (i, j) pairs: O(n\\\\xb2) per test case (since i < j, it's O(n\\\\xb2/2) operations).\\\\\\\\n  - Constructing the matrix: O(n\\\\xb2) per test case.\\\\\\\\n- Since the sum of n\\\\xb2 over all test cases is \\\\u2264 1e6, this is efficient.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### C++ Implementation Steps\\\\\\\\n1.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Got it, let's address the critical mistake pointed out in the self-criticism: **we must check for parity compatibility before attempting to unite nodes in the DSU**. The previous approach skipped this check, which could lead to invalid DSU states and incorrect matrix construction. Here's the revised, correct reasoning and implementation plan:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Critical Fix: Validate Parity Compatibility Before Uniting\\\\\\\\nWhen processing (i, j) (i < j), we can't just unite i and j with the required parity\\\\u2014we first need to check if they are already connected. If they are, we must verify that their existing parity matches the required parity for the minimal value. If it doesn't, we **can't** choose the minimal value (we have to take the other value), and we do **not** perform any DSU operation (since it would create a conflict).\\\\n\\\\nHmm, I assumed that by checking if (root_i == root_j && existing_parity != required_parity) and skipping the union in such cases, I was preserving correctness. That part is fine. But I overlooked a more fundamental modeling issue: I tried to enforce the minimal value (between A[i][j] and A[j][i]) even when the values are equal\\\\u2014leading to unnecessary parity constraints.\\\\n\\\\nThis assumption is flawed. If A[i][j] == A[j][i], there's no need to enforce any parity constraint since both values are the same regardless of the parity between i and j. Forcing a union here can accidentally restrict future choices by unnecessarily fixing the parity between unrelated nodes. This subtle oversight can cascade into incorrect behavior later, especially when earlier constraints prevent selecting the correct value in later cells due to premature unions.\\\\n\\\\nThis flaw leads to failure by introducing spurious parity links, which can later conflict with real constraints that arise when unequal values are encountered. It breaks the matrix construction by biasing parity relations that shouldn't be fixed at all, reducing flexibility.\",\n",
